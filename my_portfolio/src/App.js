            <a href="https://github.com/sooanp/Cluster_Analysis">Cluster Analysis</a>: End-to-End software engineering team project from univesity course. Mainly worked
            as a front-end developer as part of the team. Using the preprocessed geo data, we create a web application
            that re-districts Florida, Illinois, and Lousiana states based on different filters such as population density, race, etc.
            Also, the application provides cluster analysis of different state districtions.

            <a href="https://github.com/sooanp/Unsupervised_Continual_Learning_Spiking_Neural_Network">Unsupervised Continual Learning with Spiking Neural Network</a>: Main experimental project
            I performed in Brain-inspired Computing Lab. In order to mitigate catastrophic forgetting of continual learning while maintaining unsupervised learning ability,
            I have implemented a dynamic network architectural spiking neural network. SNN was chosen inspired by its' bio-plausibility. Even though neural networks were
            originally inspired by human brains, they still suffered from catastrophic forgetting unlike humans. This thought lead me to use Spiking neural network, a third-generational neural network
            to handle this task. After multiple experiments and extensive research, I was able to achieve average of 92% accuracy on split MNIST task in unsupervised learning environment, comparable to
            other similar studies.
